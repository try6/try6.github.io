      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-scaling-law&#34;&gt;What is Scaling law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists always expect to summarize the unified laws of the complex world. Physicists have come a long way in search of basic laws. As early as the 17th century, Kepler summarized the three major laws of planetary motion from Tycho&amp;rsquo;s astronomical observational data. However, for the complexity science, everything is just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subject of complexity science is complex systems, and there is currently no perfect unified theory that encompasses all complex systems. However, there exists a theory with such potential, whether it is the richly diverse life system, cities with various forms around the world, or seemingly random economic systems, they all have a unified form of characterization â€”- this is the scaling law.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
