<meta name=viewport content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1"><meta name=description content="Network completion is more challenging than link prediction, as it aims to infer both missing links and nodes. Although various methods exist for this problem, few utilize structural information-specifically, the similarity of local connection patterns. In this study, we introduce a model called C-GIN, which captures local structural patterns in the observed portions of a network using a Graph Auto-Encoder equipped with a Graph Isomorphism Network. This model generalizes these patterns to complete the entire graph. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world networks across diverse domains indicate that C-GIN not only requires less information but also outperforms baseline prediction models in most cases. Additionally, we propose a metric known as “Reachable Clustering Coefficient (RCC)” based on network structure. Experiments reveal that C-GIN performs better on networks with higher Reachable CC values."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.147.1"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><meta name=author content="Tao Ruyi"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.d05fb5f317fcf33b3a52936399bdf6f47dc776516e1692e412ec7d76f4a5faa2.css><link rel=canonical href=https://try6.github.io/publications/network_complete/><meta property="og:url" content="https://try6.github.io/publications/network_complete/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Tao Ruyi's Blog"><meta property="og:title" content="Graph Completion Through Local Pattern Generalization"><meta property="og:description" content="Network completion is more challenging than link prediction, as it aims to infer both missing links and nodes.
